[By North Carolina law](https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bychapter/chapter_132.html), public records are property of the people. Below is a running list of resources for helping you access records in the public interest.

## Request template

Not sure where to start? If you're submitting a records request in North Carolina, feel free to use or remix the template below.

	<p>Pursuant to state public records law, I request access to and copies of [[[WHAT YOU WANT]]]</p>
	<p>I’d like copies of these records electronically, preferably in [[[HOW YOU WANT IT]]]. If you are unable to provide the records in this format for any reason, please let me know.</p>
	<p>If applicable, please provide these records as they are processed.</p>
	<p>Please notify me in advance of any fees associated with this request, and if my request is denied in whole or part, I ask that you justify all deletions and redactions by reference to specific exemptions in the state open records act.</p>
